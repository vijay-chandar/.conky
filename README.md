Just my conky configuration to reproduce the dex-miladriel-ui conky setup
This work was inspired by seenaburns and his amazing ui futuristic desktop 
called dex-ui.

To use this conky you have to copy it into your .conky folder under your home directory
## Preconfiguration
### If the .conky folder exists:
Type the command:

cd ~/.conky

### If the .conky folder does not exist:
Type the following commands:

mkdir ~/.conky

cd ~/.conky


## Download and installation
After that you have to clone this git repo or download the content via the download link:

### With the git command:
git clone https://github.com/yanice/.conky.git



### With the wget command:
wget https://github.com/yanice/.conky/archive/master.zip

unzip master.zip

mv ./.conky-master/* ~/.conky/

## Launching
After that, launch the "launch_conky" script by double clicking on him or by running the 
command:

sh ~/.conky/launch_conky
